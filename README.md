# permission-demo

A project I have set up to demonstrate using various policy-as-code tools for
permission management.

I built one for OPA, but it needed various SSL certs to work properly for the purposes
of my demo, so I am not making that one public

2023-09-21 - This one is a demo of permit.io PBAC.  Others will follow.
